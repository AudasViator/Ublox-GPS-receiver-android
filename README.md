Provide mock location data from serial to usb ublox 7020 GPS

## Purpose

I wanted to get a more accurate GPS fix when using google maps navigation, so I brought this: [http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Wholesale-GPS-engine-board-Module-with-Antenna-USB-interface-G-Mouse-LUY-VK-162-Replace/1675335518.html](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Wholesale-GPS-engine-board-Module-with-Antenna-USB-interface-G-Mouse-LUY-VK-162-Replace/1675335518.html) 

And I built this!

It creates a background service once it picks up the device and you click on the device in the device list.
